The researchers find multiple problems with ergonomics, preparedness, and well-being. However, the root cause of all problems is intra-team coordination. 

Unlike global outsourcing, The researchers did not observe coordination problems usually associated with other global outsourcing, such as cultural differences, timezone differences, and the conflict between onshore and Offshore teams. In contrast, the real problem is poor communication. Teams often go into unproductive discussions, such as the best way to implement a specific function. As a result of the lowered productivity, the team members experienced guilty and Unhappiness. 

Working remotely made participants feel that the task they were assigned could have been more explicit and that they were less confident that they and their colleagues were on the same page. They tended to spend more time validating each other's work to ensure they were working towards the same objective. The need for more clarity also increased help requests within the team to solve and clarify issues and further decreased job dissatisfaction. 

The cure for reduced communication is strengthening group cohesion and effective communication. Teams with high group cohesion share the same goals and self-identity. They feel they belong to the same team and therefore are more motivated. Team members result in a better understanding of the overall goals of the project. Otherwise, people will start feeling detached from the team and encounter coordination problems. However, working from home undermined team cohesion. Pre-covid, cohesion was built using brainstorming sessions and team ceremonies. After-covid, participants tried hard to maintain high morale after switching to working from home. Some teams started adjusting their work to adapt to the changing work dynamics, such as extending the time of daily standup, spring planning, and retrospective meetings. Some teams migrated from scrum to Kanban to remove the unpredictability created by the two-week sprint. The measures were effective, participants reported that the work quality was not impacted, but it took longer to complete due to the reduced productivity. 

Technologies became the bedrock of communication. Participants increasingly rely on instant messaging, video conferencing, shared documents, and meeting minutes to communicate effectively. During work from home, face-to-face communication is removed; communication relies more on documentation and asynchronous communication. It forces the teams to coordinate more formally and rely on technology-oriented communication. Teams need to organize more team ceremonies,  such as daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings, to get everyone on the same page and strengthen team cohesion. The researchers observed a growing trend of using point-to-point communication or communication within a team's sub-group. Improvised communication channel creates knowledge silos and further confuse team members. 

Participants also reported that they were frequently interrupted by their family members. Team members who have to take care of young children often need to play a balancing act between work and family responsibilities. Their concentrations are often disrupted by their children. Taking care of young children also decreased the time they were available for synchronous communication.
