Grounded theory is a method for generating theory, it uses various techniques such as data collection, analysis, induction, coding, memoing and comparison. It studies real-life events and personal accounts to identify concepts explaining the social phenomenon. The constructivist variant of grounded theory, in particular, involves the researcher participating in the construction of the theory, rather than having them as outside observer. 

The site picked by the researcher is a software company in Brazil. The first author, at the time of research, was an employee of the company, as a tester, since 2020. When COVID-19 hit Brazil in early 2020, the company quickly formulated an emergency committee to respond to the pandemic. Within a month the company announced a complete switchover to remote work model, i.e., work-from-home. 

The authors used three techniques during data collection: participant observation, collection of asynchronous communication, and interviews. 

Participant observation includes the first author's first-person participation in the team ceremonies, such as daily standup, biweekly, retrospective meeting, regular client meetings, and most importantly, the organizational meetings on the company's pandemic response. 

Collection of asynchronous communication using the digital ethnographic technique, Slack messages, retrospective boards, meeting minutes, and emails. 

Semi-structured interviews with participants. The author interviewed not only members of the company but also employees from other companies with diverse backgrounds and profiles. The interview ran between 30 to 60 minutes and was conducted over the instant messaging software slack. 

Out of the three methods, participant observation is the dominant data source of the research because it was the the authors first-person account of the events that happened while participating in the team. The authors then interviewed participants to collaborate and corroborate concepts that emerged from their observations. The participants were asked about the feeling after switching to working from home, the advantages, challenges, impacts, lesson learned, and their expectation for the future. They were also asked to share their opinions about the company's response to the pandemic. 

The authors analyzed the materials by going over the material line by line, extracting statements related to the research topic. For non-text materials, such as images, the authors write memos about them and analyze them just like text. After that, they conduct interviews and apply the same elicitation technique on the transcription of the interviews. 

Finally, they assessed, refined, and reorganized the statement into categories, then provided their findings to the participants to validate and clarify the concept represented by the categories. They did this refine and validation process iteratively until all categories had internal cohesion and connected to the same conclusion.
