The paper investigates the impact work-from-home arrangement has on software engineering teams. In particular, how working-from-home arrangements, which emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, impact software professionals and teams.

Companies were forced to shift to work from home (WFH) during COVID-19, and WFH is now becoming a norm. There are signs that the work model may never return to the pre-COVID era, given that supporting infrastructure has been developed and people are already accustomed to working from home. People also see many benefits of working from home, such as the shortened commute time. There are even news stories about people threatening to resign if they are forced to go back to office.

This paradigm shift may lead the software industry back to pre-agile processes. Teams need to compromise many agile practices in a remote setting. e.g., No one stands up for a stand-up meeting; working from home forces people to focus on processes, tools, documentation, and planning. Under the remote work setting, agile teams are more prone to problems such as misunderstandings, low job satisfaction, increased help requests, and ill-defined tasks. Working from home also creates information silos. Rather than sitting together and discussing issues in next-to-desk conversation, communication now happens more often online in chat groups, where topics are discussed within channels or sub-groups instead of shared with the whole team. Apart from the productivity impact, work-from-home also impacts an employee's well-being, e.g., ergonomics of their home office configuration, distractions from family, speed of their broadband, and child care are some of the more common nuisances.

The authors argue that the core of all issues was coordination. Coordination integrates or links different people to perform a collected set of tasks and manage dependencies between different tasks. There are two significant types of coordination: the vertical and the peer models. In vertical coordination, the project manager decides what works are and who performs it. This coordination model is also known as the push-based work model. In the peer coordination model, coordination happens based on the team's mutual understanding of tasks. Peer coordination is also known as the pull-based work model. Regardless of the model, communication is a critical element of coordinationâ€”however, many struggles to understand the optimal level of communication needed. Besides communication, coordination deals with non-communication problems, such as human resources, time constraints, and technical complexities.

There were studies on remote work styles. The four main remote work styles are colocated, distributed, hybrid and remote-first. Some study focuses on distributed working models, e.g., off-shore software development; others focus on the work-from-home arrangement in industries other than software engineering; there are studies about work-from-home during everyday situations. However, previous studies assume employees are well prepared to transition to work-from-home. This paper explores the scenario where employees need more preparation when COVID-19 strikes.
