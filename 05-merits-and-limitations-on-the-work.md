Under the remote working environment, having structured documentation to keep everyone on the same page seems unavoidable. However, the paper needed to explore optimizing the documentation work without sacrificing work momentum. One way is to make documentation part of the development process, so document changes go through code review. 

The paper increased synchronized communication to helped maintained high team cohesion but did not address how to mitigate the knowledge silo created by improvised communication channels and how to avoid excessive synchronized communication to the point of turning work day into a streaming show. A recommendation is to restrict the creation of private channels and allocate private time during the workday.

Communication is not software engineering specific. The paper needs to explore how technology can solve software engineer-specific issues. Such as lack of trust and repeated validation. A recommendation is to resolve minor code issues using auto bug repair (APR) and linter software and enable pair programming using a collaborative environment such as Visual Studio Code LiveShare. 

For the social aspect of issues, members and teams need to be compassionate for members with kids. Realistically, companies should allocate extra time for team members' childcare. 

Covid is a thing of the past for most of the world. However, the work model in many places has shifted to distributed teams. The studies and recommendations made in this paper will still be relevant in the foreseeable future.
