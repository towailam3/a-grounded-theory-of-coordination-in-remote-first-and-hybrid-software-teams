The paper investigates the impact work-from-home arrangement has on software engineering teams. In particular, the paper investigates working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting software professionals and teams.

Before work-from-home arrangements emerged, there were four types of remote working models: colocated, distributed, hybrid and remote-first. 

Under the remote settings, the team encountered problems such as misunderstandings, low job satisfaction, increased help requests, and ill-defined tasks. 

The authors argue that the core issue was one of coordination. Coordination integrates or links different people to perform a collected set of tasks, and 
managing dependencies between different tasks. 

In vertical coordination, the project manager decides who performs which work. This coordination model is also known as the push-based work model. 

In the peer coordination model, coordination is based on mutual understanding.el  This is also known as the pull-based work model. 

Regardless of the coordination model, communication is vital. But many struggles to understand the optimal level of communication needed. 

Besides communication, coordination also deals with noncommunication coordination problems, such as human resources, time constraints, and technical complexities.
