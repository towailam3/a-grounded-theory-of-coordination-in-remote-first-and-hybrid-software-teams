The problem this paper investigates is vital because companies are shifting to work from home during COVID-19 and beyond. 

There are signs that the work model may never return to pre-COVID because infrastructure has been developed and implemented to support this model of working. 

People are also accustomed to the benefits of working from home, such as the shortened commute time. There are stories about people threatening to entirely if forced back to work in an office.

The agile project management paradigm is being challenged because many values that agile promotes, such as face-to-face communication, and minimizing documentation, are challenged by the non-face-to-face environment in work-from-home settings.

This paradigm shift may lead the software industry to backslide toward pre-agile processes.
Teams need to compromise many agile practices. e.g., No one stands up for a stand-up meeting alone in their home office.

Working from home encourages professionals to focus on processes, tools, documentation, and planning. 

Covid-19 negatively impacts productivity and employees' well-being. Ergonomics of their home office configuration, distractions, broadband, and child care are some of the more common productivity killers. 

Working from home also creates information silos. Now communication can more easily happen within subgroups within a specific chat channel instead of sharing with the whole team.

On the bright side, open-source data projects helped the community to respond to the covid crisis.
